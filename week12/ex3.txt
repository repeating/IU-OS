without O_SYNC:

- file size: 10M
	- DBUF: 100 bytes   -> sys0m0.184s
	- DBUF: 512 bytes   -> sys0m0.044s

with O_SYNC:

- file size: 10M
	- DBUF: 100 bytes   -> sys0m2.744s
	- DBUF: 512 bytes   -> sys0m0.496s

with O_SYNC time of operations become bigger,it is very important for speed, especially for small buffer.
